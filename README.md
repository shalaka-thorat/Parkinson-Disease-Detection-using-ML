### What is Parkinson's Disease:
Parkinson's disease is a type of disorder of our central nervous system. This disorder affects the movement of a person.<br>
Damage of nerve cells in the brain lead to this disease. Other symptoms are posture imbalance, slow movement and tremor- rhythmic shaking of body parts.<br>

This diesase can last for years, or life long as well. Treatment can help, but cannot cure this disorder. People usually develop this disease around 60 years age or older.<br>

### What is the Dataset about:
The dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 of them have Parkinson's disease. Each column of the table is a voice measure and there are a total of 195 measurements gathered in the dataset.

Attributes Explanation:<br>

name - Subject name and Recording <br>
MDVP:Fo(Hz) - Average vocal fundamental frequency<br>
MDVP:Fhi(Hz) - Maximum vocal fundamental frequency<br>
MDVP:Flo(Hz) - Minimum vocal fundamental frequency<br>
MDVP:Jitter(%),MDVP:Jitter(Abs),MDVP:RAP,MDVP:PPQ,Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency<br>
MDVP:Shimmer,MDVP:Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,MDVP:APQ,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude<br>
NHR,HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice<br>
status - Health status of the subject (one) - Parkinson's, (zero) - healthy<br>
RPDE,D2 - Two nonlinear dynamical complexity measures<br>
DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent<br>
spread1,spread2,PPE - Three nonlinear measures of fundamental frequency variation<br>
